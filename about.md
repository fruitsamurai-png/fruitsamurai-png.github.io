# About page

An aspiring software developer with a strong passion for working and interacting with people. I enjoy working in a group and also being in a dynamic environment, along with a love for developing video games for people to enjoy.
Currently, a senior undergraduate undertaking a bachelor's in Computer Science in Interactive Media and Game Design at Digipen Singapore.
Proficient in technical production through several project management methods like scrums and kanban, experienced with working with commercial game engines like Unity and custom ones that my project teams and I implemented. Hoping to be a part of something bigger!
