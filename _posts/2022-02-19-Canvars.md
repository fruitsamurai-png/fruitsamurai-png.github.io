### Project Demo

ReactJS was used to build the UI of the web app, using additional frameworks such as React Bootstrap and React Router to speed up the development process. AWS Amplify components were also used, to some extent, to import UI designed in figma.The backend framework that was used was AWS Amplify, which lets us focus our efforts on the front end. The AWS Amplify backend automatically allocates AWS resources such as AppSync for the GraphQL API, S3 storage for images, DynamoDB for database, etc.

### My Contributions 
- Design and prototyped the layout using Figma
- Developed Single Page Application using React and Node.js
- Integrated and deployed scalable cloud database using AWS DynamoDB
